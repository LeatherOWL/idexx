                "description": "Sport climbers often project a route that tests their physical limits in hopes of an eventual completion, regardless of the number of attempts. Succeeding requires a solid understanding of belaying and other climbing techniques that are used in various climbing disciplines, but are detailed here specifically for sport climbing. Targeting varying abilities, Sport Climbing teaches climbers how to rehearse moves and train for routes, how to get through the pump, how to fight until the endof a pitch, how to stay composed when tired, and how to best use their bodies to climb efficiently and expertly. Whether inspiring new climbers to learn the nuances of scaling vertical terrain, or delving into a deeper, more conceptual understanding of how to go about projecting a route, Andrew Bisharat brings confidence and a level of practicality to the sport. He demonstrates how skills specific to redpointing transfer over to traditional climbing, making this a must-have book for any climber.Featuring tips from famous climbers such as Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold, the author brings a modern voice to a fun and exciting sport.",

The farther from the ground a climb leads, the more technical proficiency and careful planning will make the difference between a worthy adventure and miserable epic. Climbing: From Single Pitch to Multi-Pitch complements instruction, ground school, and practice with a procedural approach to planning and preparation, leading anchoring and belaying, transitions, technical descent, and emergency preparedness. Before you get in way way over your head, make sure the essential skills outlined in this book have been reviewed, rehearsed, and individualized.",
